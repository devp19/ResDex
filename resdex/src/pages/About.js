        ResDex is a student-led organization aimed towards bridging the gap between academia and industry-level research publications, making it easier for students to find research-assistant positions and go beyond the traditional academic scope to create impactful research papers.

      <br></br>
Giving students the opportunity to stand out among millions, review and edit papers, and connect with PHD level researchers, ResDex is designed to foster a collaborative academic community, allowing users to showcase their research, achievements, and certifications in a dynamic online portfolio.

By engaging in peer and expert reviews, students can refine their work, gain valuable feedback, and build meaningful connections with academics and professionals in their field.

      <h3> Objective</h3>
      We understand the difficulty and often timely process of cold-emailing hundreds of professors for research positions. While all is said and done, research itself is a hard industry to really gain experience in.
    <br></br>
    <br></br>
“That’s where ResDex comes into play.”
<br></br>
    <br></br>
As a research-sharing platform, designed for students by students, we tailored the platform to fit those exact needs. Everything a student needs all on one site to help the user really build a portfolio around their contributions to the world of research.
