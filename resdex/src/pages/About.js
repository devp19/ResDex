<h3 className='primary monarque'>Mission Statement – ResDex</h3>
    <br></br>
      <p className='primary'>As students, we understand the difficulty and often timely process of cold-emailing hundreds of professors for research positions. While all is said and done, research itself is a hard industry to really gain experience in.</p>
      <br></br>
      <i className='monarque primary'>–“That’s where ResDex comes into play.”</i>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <p className='primary'>As a research-sharing platform, designed for students by students, we tailored the platform to fit those exact needs. Everything a student needs all on one site to help the user really build a portfolio around their contributions to the world of research.</p>
