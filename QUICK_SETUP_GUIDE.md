## 📱 What You'll See

### **New Research Digest Interface:**
- **Header**: "AI-Powered Research Digest" with date and article count
- **Source Tags**: Shows how many articles from arXiv and ScienceDaily
- **Article Cards**: Each article shows:
  - Title (clickable link)
  - Source badge (arXiv/ScienceDaily)
  - Authors and publication date
  - Summary/abstract
  - Category and "Read Full Article" link
- **Refresh Button**: Get fresh articles anytime

### **Fallback to Legacy Format:**
If the new format doesn't work, it will automatically show the legacy digest format.

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

1. **On Page Load**: Automatically fetches today's research digest
2. **If No Data**: Shows "No articles found" with a "Fetch New Articles" button
3. **On Refresh**: Fetches fresh articles from both sources
4. **Error Handling**: Shows user-friendly error messages with retry options

## 🔍 Troubleshooting
