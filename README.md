### About
ResDex is a student-friendly, accessible research paper “publishing” platform that gives students the opportunity to stand out among millions, review and edit papers, and connect with PHD level researchers. Designed to foster a collaborative academic community, ResDex allows users to showcase their research, achievements, and certifications in a dynamic online portfolio. 

By engaging in peer and expert reviews, students can refine their work, gain valuable feedback, and build meaningful connections with academics and professionals in their field.

### Objective 
We understand the difficulty and often timely process of cold-emailing hundreds of professors for research positions. While all is said and done, research itself is a hard industry to really gain experience in. 

*“That’s where ResDex comes into play.”* 

 
As a research-sharing platform, designed for students by students, we tailored the platform to fit those exact needs. Everything a student needs all on one site to help the user really build a portfolio around their contributions to the world of research.
